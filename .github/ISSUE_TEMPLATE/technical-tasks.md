**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
We currently face challenges in achieving efficient and reliable testing for our project. Manual testing is time-consuming, prone to errors, and doesn't provide adequate coverage for different browsers and platforms. We need a robust and scalable solution to streamline our testing process.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to implement Playwright as our primary test automation framework for the project. Playwright offers cross-browser and cross-platform support, enabling us to run tests on multiple browsers and devices effortlessly. With its rich interaction capabilities, we can thoroughly test complex UI scenarios, ensuring accurate and consistent test results.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
We have considered using other test automation frameworks like Selenium and Cypress. While both are popular choices, Playwright stands out due to its unique capabilities, such as supporting multiple browsers and devices with the same codebase. Playwright's powerful API also makes it an attractive option for handling complex UI interactions and asynchronous actions.

**Additional context**
Our project is rapidly growing, and manual testing is becoming a bottleneck in our development and release cycles. By adopting Playwright for automated testing, we aim to reduce testing time, increase test coverage, and improve the overall quality of our software. The Playwright community is active and continuously improving the framework, making it a reliable choice for our testing needs.

# Create a Technical user story**
As a member of the development team, I want all code to pass through Playwright's automated tests before each pull request is merged. This is to ensure that all new or changed features meet expectations, as well as to prevent any potential regression errors from entering the main branch.


# User Story

# Acceptance Criteria
- GitHub Action Execution: The GitHub Action "Playwright Tests" should be successfully triggered and run on any push or pull request to the main or master branches.
- Dependency Installation: All necessary dependencies, including node version 18 and Playwright browsers, should be installed successfully.
- Playwright Test Execution: The Playwright tests outlined in your script myTest.spec.js should run and pass successfully.
- Artifact Upload: If an artifact named playwright-report is produced, it should be successfully uploaded and retained for 30 days.
