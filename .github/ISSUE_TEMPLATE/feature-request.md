**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I often find it straining on the eyes to use the application in a brightly lit environment or during nighttime. Having a bright interface can lead to eye fatigue and discomfort.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like the application to have a dark mode option that changes the color scheme to a darker palette, providing better contrast and reducing eye strain. This feature would make it easier to use the application in low-light conditions.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
An alternative could be manually adjusting the brightness or using third-party browser extensions to enable dark mode. However, having an official dark mode within the application would be more convenient and ensure a consistent user experience.

**Additional context**
Attaching a screenshot from another application with a dark mode feature to illustrate the idea. This feature is becoming increasingly popular in various applications and websites, and it would be great to have it in our project as well.
